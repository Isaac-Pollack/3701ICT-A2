# ``A2 - Mobile App Development``

Assessment 2 / Milestone 1

## Overview

During Milestone 1, I've learnt more about:
- Classes & particularly extensions
- Optional data (more on)
- More on Guards
- Error Handling
- Data persistance through Core Data and ObservableObjects.


This Milestone has implemented:
- A master/detail view
- Minimalist pages, simple and sleek
- SwiftDocC
- A design focused on Seperation of Concerns
- Full data persistence including correct data types within my core data model.

Takeaways:
- This milestone provided many methods to achieve the same thing, and once I reached the course contents end up to this assessment, that is when I truly pieced everything together for a cohesive design.
- Bindings make lots more sense now, and I much prefer this method and Core Data design over previous milestones.
- I did find some things quirky, particularly nested lists. Styling these causes unknown effects, if any at all.
